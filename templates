Template: shared/mailname
Type: string
_Description: Mailname of your system:
 This is the fully-qualified host name of the computer running dma.
 It defaults to the output of "hostname --fqdn".

Template: dma/relayhost
Type: string
_Description: Smarthost:
 This is the name of a remote server to which to send each message.
 If it is left blank, dma will try to deliver all messages by itself;
 however, for the present it cannot really handle MX record lookups.
 The default is a host named "mail" in the same domain as your computer.

Template: dma/dbounceprog
Type: string
_Description: A program to handle double-bounces:
 This is the name of a program that dma will invoke when a bounced
 message bounces in its own right.  Leave this blank if you like dma's
 default behavior of simply aborting the delivery, or specify the name
 or full path to a program that will process the double-bounce message.
