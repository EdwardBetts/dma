dma (0.0.2009.02.11-1~2) unstable; urgency=low

  * Add four new patches:
    - lock the newly-created files to prevent double delivery attempts
      if "dma -q" is run at just the wrong time;
    - provide the proper bounce message on failed deliveries;
    - add the FULLBOUNCE option;
    - add the MAILNAME and MAILNAMEFILE options and use /etc/mailname
      as the MAILNAMEFILE.
  * Add debian/README.source to document quilt usage as required by Policy.
